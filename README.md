#Virtual_Mouse_Project

The Virtual Mouse project combines computer graphics and image processing to produce a 
touchless interaction device. A webcam monitors hand movements and detects when the thumb 
and index finger come together to simulate a mouse click. This gesture-based control enhances 
hygiene and accessibility by reducing physical contact with devices. The project incorporates 
real-time video processing, feature extraction, and gesture detection, demonstrating practical 
applications for these technologies. This novel approach has the potential to help a wide range 
of industries, including healthcare, public kiosks, and smart home environments, by providing 
an easy and frictionless means of computer interaction.

The Virtual Mouse project uses advanced computer vision and image processing 
techniques to create a touchless device for operating a computer cursor. Using a camera, 
the system continuously takes live video feeds and processes them to detect and track 
hand movements. It specifically recognizes the gesture of the thumb and index finger 
coming together to replicate a mouse click. This unique gesture-based control method 
improves hygiene and accessibility by eliminating the need for physical touch with input 
devices, which is especially useful in public and healthcare environments. The project 
uses OpenCV and Python to implement real-time video processing, robust hand detection, 
and accurate gesture recognition algorithms. The technology converts these gestures into 
cursor movements and click operations, ensuring a smooth and responsive user 
experience. Beyond traditional computing environments, the virtual mouse has potential 
applications in public vending machines, smart home interfaces, and accessibility tools 
for people with mobility impairments, demonstrating the usefulness and versatility of 
computer graphics and image processing technologies.
