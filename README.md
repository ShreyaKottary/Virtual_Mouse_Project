The Virtual Mouse project combines computer graphics and image processing to produce a 
touchless interaction device. A webcam monitors hand movements and detects when the thumb 
and index finger come together to simulate a mouse click. This gesture-based control enhances 
hygiene and accessibility by reducing physical contact with devices. The project incorporates 
real-time video processing, feature extraction, and gesture detection, demonstrating practical 
applications for these technologies. This novel approach has the potential to help a wide range 
of industries, including healthcare, public kiosks, and smart home environments, by providing 
an easy and frictionless means of computer interaction.
